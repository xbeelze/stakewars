Setup and Installation NEAR CLI
View Validator Stats
Note: For security reasons, it is recommended that NEAR-CLI be installed on a different computer than your validator node and that no full access keys be kept on your validator node.

First, let's make sure the linux machine is up-to-date.

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
Install developer tools, Node.js, and npm
First, we will start with installing Node.js and npm:

curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -  
sudo apt install build-essential nodejs
PATH="$PATH"
Check Node.js and npm version:

node -v
v18.x.x

npm -v
8.x.x

Install NEAR-CLI
Here's the Github Repository for NEAR CLI.: https://github.com/near/near-cli. To install NEAR-CLI, unless you are logged in as root, which is not recommended you will need to use sudo to install NEAR-CLI so that the near binary is saved to /usr/local/bin

sudo npm install -g near-cli

Command:

export NEAR_ENV=shardnet
You can also run this command to set the Near testnet Environment persistent:

echo 'export NEAR_ENV=shardnet' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export NEAR_ENV=shardnet' >> ~/.bash_profile
source $HOME/.bash_profile
