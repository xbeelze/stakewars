Steps
We have launched a new validator scoreboard for ShardNet where you can monitor your uptime and metrics of your validator: ShardNet Uptime Leaderboard

Objective 1 - Monitor uptime
Check your current uptime and manage it to above 70% on ShardNet
Fix issues with producing chunks. See the troubleshooting guide
Implement monitoring scripts
Objective 2 - Open Port 3030 for Diagnostic reporting
Check to see if PORT 3030 is open

sudo iptables -L | grep 3030
Open the port if not open

sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 3030 -j ACCEPT
Save the config for server restarts

You can use one of the 2 solutions:

Using iptables-persistent
sudo apt install iptables-persistent
or if already installed

sudo dpkg-reconfigure iptables-persistent
Using files
iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
ip6tables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v6
Validate the port is open by visiting
`http://:3030/status

NOTE: In some cases the port may also need to be opened in your cloud provider / datacenter firewall.

Acceptance criteria:
Validator reporting above 70%
Port can be accessed publicly http://<IP Address>:3030/status
Challenge submission
Challenge URL: The link to your port 3030 port
Challenge image: Screenshot of uptime from Leaderboard
